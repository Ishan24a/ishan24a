    <h4>Personality: </h4>
    The Arctic wolf is not very frightened of humans and in some locations can be encouraged to approach them.  Because they see humans so infrequently, it is believed that the wolves of Ellesmere Island do not fear people and will approach them warily and carefully.During the Fram voyage, two wolves followed one of Otto Sverdrup's crew members. He kept them at a distance by waving his ski pole.
<h4>Interesting Facts:-</h4>
The Better to Hear You With - Compared to other wolf subspecies, Arctic wolves have smaller ears. Animals in hot climates benefit from large ears like those of hares because they assist lower body temperature.
The Better to See You With - Arctic wolves have all-white fur, in contrast to their "grey" brethren. Compared to the snow around them, the wolves' white coat makes it difficult for prey to notice them.
These wolves also have thick fur between the pads of their toes, making it easier for them to touch you. Wolves' feet can get quite cold on the bottom, and they could develop frostbite if they lacked the thick fur that covers the pads there.</td>
